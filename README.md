Another sorting program -- this time, heap sort.  Implement the heap with your own code, and use the fast O(n) build-heap to initially construct a heap.  After that, extract the maximum element out, putting it at the end of your vector, and reduce the size of the heap.

Your code should print the sorted numbers in the same way that the merge sort program operated.

Include comments, and in the comments -- run your own merge sort and heap sort, and include the time taken for one million and ten million random number files (use the gendata program in the sorting folder).

Which one is faster?  Check the run times -- is it roughly a constant factor if you compare the 1M and 10M runs?

This info should be in the comments at the top of your code.  Include what sort of computer you ran things on.
